# BeatAutosaver

BeatAutosaver is a program that automatically sorts your beats and loops by week. This makes sending out weekly beat or loop packs hassle free. Currently, BeatAutosaver only works on macOS.

Currently, your beats must be saved as `.mp3` files using the following naming convention:

    <type>_<name>_<bpm>_<producers>.mp3

All spaces in the name or the producers' names must be replaced with a `_`. For example:

    beat_soft_keys_98_ty_omg.mp3

In this example, the `type` is `beat`, the `name` is `soft_keys`, the `bpm` is `98`, and the `producers` are `ty` and `omg`.

To mark a `.mp3` as a loop, simply begin the name with `loop`, like so:

    loop_over_the_hill_123_ty.mp3

## Installation

To install, run:

    sudo ./install.sh

When prompted, input the folder where you save your beats and the folder where you'd like your weekly folders to be. For now, these paths must be absolute (no `~` or relative paths).

BeatAutosaver requires `python3` and `fswatch`. If either or both are not installed, the installer will take the liberty to install them for you at no extra cost. Xcode Command Line Tools are also required, but you will have to install them manually. To install them, try running:

    xcode-select â€“install

## Configuration

To update your settings, go to your install directory and open `config.sh`. Some settings require a restart of the launch agent to be applied. To do that, run:

    launchctl stop com.tyos.BeatAutosaver.plist
    launchctl start com.tyos.BeatAutosaver.plist

## Running

BeatAutosaver will automatically run after install. Currently, BeatAutosaver will copy any file that looks like a beat or a loop that has been created or changed to its respective weekly folder. If you want to search through your entire beat folder and sort all your beats at once, navigate to your install directory and run:

    ./beat_autosaver.sh --all

## Future Improvements

I am working on implementing the following:

-   Compatibility with more naming conventions
-   Installing with a traditional .pkg installer
-   UI interface to manage settings and unload/reload launch agent
-   Ability to change last day of week (currently Sunday)
-   Download python3 and fswatch on install rather than including them in git repo
